# Safer GitHub Actions Workflow for golangci-lint

This workflow downloads, verifies, and runs [golangci/golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) in a deterministic, easy to audit, and safe manner.

## Why use safer-golangci-lint.yml?

What you download and execute shouldn't be able to change at anytime without your review. Linting the same source code should produce deterministic results unless you choose to modify the workflow or linter settings.

Directly executing the output of curl, etc. without verifying the integrity of the downloaded script is risky.  The [Codecov bash script incident](https://www.securityweek.com/codecov-bash-uploader-dev-tool-compromised-supply-chain-hack) is an example of what can happen.

Everything you need to download, verify, and execute a verified file should be self-contained in your workflow and under your control.

## safer-golangci-lint.yml

100% of the script for downloading, verifying, and running golangci-lint is embedded in the workflow file.  You can review it once and continuously use it knowing it won't be changed by a 3rd party unless you update the script yourself in your repo.

The embedded SHA-256 digest is used to verify the downloaded golangci-lint tarball (e.g. golangci-lint-1.49.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz). It matches the official checksums file at https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases.

More specifically, this workflow:

1. Avoids downloading and executing unverified wrapper scripts.  
   See https://www.securityweek.com/codecov-bash-uploader-dev-tool-compromised-supply-chain-hack
2. Uses openssl instead of sha256sum because it's easier to change hash algo to BLAKE2s, SHA3-256, etc.
3. Uses embedded SHA-256 because CHECKSUM file isn't digitally signed.  The embedded SHA-256 matches the official CHECKSUM file and it cannot change without you change safer-golangci-lint.yml in your repo.

## Quick Start
Step 1. Copy [safer-golangci-lint.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x448/safer-golangci-lint/main/safer-golangci-lint.yml) into [github_repo]/.github/workflows/  
Step 2. There's no step 2 if you like the default settings.

You can use a config file (.golangci.yml) as described by the [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) project.

## Upgrading to newer version of golangci-lint

Just copy the latest version of safer-golangci-lint.yml into your .github/workflows folder.

Or if you don't want to wait for an update, you can:

1. specify new version number in GOLINTERS_VERSION
2. specify new hash of tarball in GOLINTERS_TGZ_HASH

## Release v1.50.1
